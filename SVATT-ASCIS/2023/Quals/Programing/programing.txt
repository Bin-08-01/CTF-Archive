Find the secret digit
Bob: Hey Alice, did you know that the result of deviding a by b might be a terminating decimal number or a recurring one?

Alice: What kind of number is that? ü§î

Bob: Well, the terminating decimal numbers have a finite number of digits just after the decimal point. For Example: 98.678, 12.1199. The recurring decimal numbers are those numbers that have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point. However, these digits are repeated at regular intervals. For Example: 4.787878..., 3.3333... One fun fact is that terminating decimal numbers can become recurring decimal numbers by adding an infinite number of zeros to them.

Alice: Fascinating! An idea have just come out of my mind. Can you pinpoint the precise digit in the fraction a/b at position k after the decimal point? Supplying a,b and k is always smaller than 10^18. If you can solve my challenge, I'm gonna be your onlyfan. JKüòç

For Example:

a=100, b=8 and k=1 then the result is 5.

a=17, b=3 and k=10 then the result is 6
